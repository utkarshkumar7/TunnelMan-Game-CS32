# TunnelMan-Game-CS32

TunnelMan is a game in which the player digs underground tunnels in an oil field and gathers barrels of oils, gold nuggets, and other goodies to beat enemies and progress to the next level.
I implemented all of the functionalities of the game ranging from the goodies and weapons the character collects to the enemy interactions and level progressions.
TunnelMan PDF contains information about the specifications of this project and an in-depth description of the game.
TunnelMan folder contains the cpp and header files of different classes and members I implemented for the game.
The report document contains detailed description of how I implemented the different functions, classes, and features of this game.
